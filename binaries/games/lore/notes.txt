Hello                                     World
This is the notes file isn't it spiffy?
The notes file is here to contain any text
that you think is worthy to jot down. You can
use the notes file to record various thoughts
while you create your game, or you can use
it to include information about the game so when
people edit it they have a nice bit of notes
about it. Get it? Okay good. Yup.
